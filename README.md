# Game-of-Life
C implementation of Conway's Game of Life, exploring the effect of non-deterministic rules (quantum effects) and of different boundary conditions

The GtfVersion folder allows for the visual display of the simulations and saving and loading configurations
The DevVersion folder is meant for running automatic simulations, studying the amount of time needed for the spontaneous generation of complex structures from non-deterministic effects

In order to compile and run the GtkVersion, you must first install the Gnu ToolKit (GTK)
